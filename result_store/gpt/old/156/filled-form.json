The violation was reported by concerned citizens who noticed a strong chemical odor and observed discolored water in the river. Upon investigation, it was discovered that a manufacturing plant located upstream was responsible for the illegal dumping. The plant was found to be releasing toxic chemicals and waste directly into the river, posing a significant threat to the local ecosystem and public health. The specific directions to the violation site would be to follow the river upstream from the city center, passing through the industrial area until reaching the manufacturing plant.

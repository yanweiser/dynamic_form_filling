It was reported that a construction company had illegally dumped a large amount of construction waste in the park, causing significant damage to the natural habitat. The waste included materials such as concrete, bricks, and metal debris. The violation occurred near the entrance of the park, obstructing the pathway for visitors and posing a safety hazard. The report also mentioned that the construction company did not have the necessary permits to carry out such activities in the park. It is crucial that immediate action is taken to clean up the waste and hold the responsible party accountable for their actions. I urge the local authorities to investigate the matter thoroughly and ensure that appropriate penalties are imposed on the construction company. Additionally, I encourage the community to come together and organize a cleanup event to restore the park to its original state and raise awareness about the importance of preserving our natural environment."}, "Reporter Contact Information": {"info": "You are not required to provide your contact information but the EPA might want to reach out to you for additional information.", "Your Name": {"type": "text-field", "required": false, "answer": "Emily Johnson"}, "Your Email": {"type": "text-field", "required": false, "answer": "emilyjohnson@email.com"}, "Your Phone Number": {"type": "text-field", "required": false, "answer": "123-456-7890"}}}

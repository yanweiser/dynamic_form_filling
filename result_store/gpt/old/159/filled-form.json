The plant was found to have been disposing of toxic chemicals without proper treatment or permits, resulting in significant harm to the ecosystem and potential risks to human health. The specific directions for addressing this violation would include immediate cessation of the illegal dumping, containment and cleanup of the contaminated area, and the implementation of proper waste management practices at the manufacturing plant.

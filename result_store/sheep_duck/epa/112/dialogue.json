The specific location of the violation is approximately 20 miles off the coast of San Diego, California. The company responsible for this violation is 'West Coast Energy Solutions,' which has been conducting unauthorized gas drilling operations in a marine sanctuary that is designated for the protection of marine life and ecosystems. The company has been using advanced drilling techniques to extract natural gas from the seabed, causing significant damage to the fragile marine environment. The drilling activities have resulted in the destruction of essential habitats for various marine species, including endangered coral reefs, and have led to an increase in water pollution due to the release of toxic chemicals and drilling waste. The violation has been reported to the relevant authorities, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), who are now investigating the matter and taking necessary actions to stop the illegal activities and mitigate the environmental damage caused. In summary, the environmental violation involves illegal gas drilling activities by 'West Coast Energy Solutions' in a protected marine area off the coast of San Diego, California, causing harm to the marine ecosystem and violating environmental regulations."}]
